            <h3>Projects and Publications</h3>
            <p>
              During my undergraduate studies, I led a project on electricity market price optimization, where we developed a predictive model-based power price tagging system using hierarchical optimization and deep learning. This work is currently under review for publication. I also contributed to research on recommender systems in online airline reviews using NLP, which is under review as well. Furthermore, I recently accepted and submitted a book chapter titled Generative Transformers and Text Generation Models for IETE Generative AI Unleashed. Additionally, my internship as an Applied Scientist at Amazon involved developing an end-to-end ML system for a Gen AI-based finance tool, leveraging feedback-based retraining mechanisms to advance finance automation, further solidifying my experience in practical, impactful AI-driven innovation.
